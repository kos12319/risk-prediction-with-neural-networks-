  - Abstract/Notes: Background Efforts to minimize COVID-19 exposure during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have led to limitations in access to medical care and testing. The Tasso-SST kit includes all of the components necessary for remote, capillary blood self-collection. In this study, we sought to investigate the accuracy and reliability of the Tasso-SST device as a self-collection device for measurement of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Methods Capillary blood was obtained via unsupervised and supervised application of the Tasso-SST device, and venous blood was collected by standard venipuncture. Unsupervised self-collected blood samples underwent either extreme summer or winter-simulated shipping conditions prior to testing. Sera obtained by all three methods were tested concurrently using the EuroImmun anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG assay in a CLIA-certified clinical laboratory. Results Successful Tasso-SST capillary blood collection by unsupervised and supervised administration was completed by 93.4% and 94.5% of participants, respectively. Sera from 56 participants, 55 with documented (PCR+) COVID-19, and 33 healthy controls were then tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Compared to venous blood results, Tasso-SST-collected (unstressed) and the summer- and winter-stressed blood samples demonstrated Deming regression slopes of 1.00 (95% CI: 0.99–1.02), 1.00 (95% CI: 0.98–1.01), and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97–1.01), respectively, with an overall accuracy of 98.9%. Conclusions Capillary blood self-collection using the Tasso-SST device had a high success rate. Moreover, excellent concordance was found for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG results between Tasso-SST capillary and standard venous blood-derived sera. The Tasso-SST device should enable widespread collection of capillary blood for testing without medical supervision, facilitating epidemiologic studies.
- **li2022evaluation** — The evaluation on the credit risk of enterprises based on the combination of cnn-lstm-att

  - Abstract/Notes: Due to numerous advantages, a neutral point clamped (NPC) inverter is a preferred choice for high-power applications and renewable technology. The reliability of the NPC inverter is a major concerning factor during the assessment of system performance as power semiconductor switches are vulnerable to abnormal conditions. Open-circuit (OC) switch faults are not as dangerous as short circuit (SC) faults but eventually have enough potential to cause cascaded failure to other components in the system and thus need to be supervised carefully. The OC faults result in a distortion of voltage and current signals in the NPC converter. Based on these signals, over the past few years, many efforts have been made to identify and localize the OC switch fault to the switch level in the NPC topology. In this paper, a review of different OC switch fault diagnostic methods is provided. Starting from the NPC inverter operation under healthy and faulty conditions, the various possible and unavailable switching states along with the deviation in pole voltage under different switch fault conditions is discussed. Then, based on the approach used for system-based fault detection, the OC fault detection methods are classified. The various OC methods are further discussed on the basis of signal, i.e., current, voltage or a combination of both signals used as a signature for fault detection. Emphasis is given to the principle involved, diagnostic variables utilized, the implementation approach and the diagnostic time required. Finally, the approaches are tabulated so as to provide a quick reference for NPC fault diagnostics.

  - Links: DOI: 10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16826
  - Abstract/Notes: We propose a novel high-performance and interpretable canonical deep tabular data learning architecture, TabNet. TabNet uses sequential attention to choose which features to reason from at each decision step, enabling interpretability and more efficient learning as the learning capacity is used for the most salient features. We demonstrate that TabNet outperforms other variants on a wide range of non-performance-saturated tabular datasets and yields interpretable feature attributions plus insights into its global behavior. Finally, we demonstrate self-supervised learning for tabular data, significantly improving performance when unlabeled data is abundant.

  - Abstract/Notes: ABSTRACTEarly studies that used rolling windows found it to be a useful forecasting technique. These studies were, by‐and‐large, based on pre‐2000 data, which were nonstationary. Subsequent work, based on stationary data from the mid‐1990s to 2020, has not been able to confirm that finding. However, this latter result may reflect the fact that there was relatively little structural instability between the mid‐1990s and 2020: The data had become stationary. Following the series of shocks of the early 2020s, this is no longer the case because the shocks produced nonstationarity in the macroeconomic data, such as inflation. Consequently, rolling windows may again be a sensible way forward. The present study assesses this conjecture.

  - Abstract/Notes: To reduce the information asymmetry between investors and lenders and enable P2P lending platforms to develop more accurate lending standards, this study uses Lending Club data to build a credit scoring model based on machine learning (ML) and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms. The data is first cleaned and preprocessed through feature engineering techniques, and then trained using XGBoost to evaluate feature importance. To address the class imbalance problem, undersampling is used to divide the dataset into training and test sets. The study also uses grid search and cross-validation methods to determine the best hyperparameters for four algorithms (logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), lightweight gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and XGBoost). Finally, this paper compares and analyzes the performance of different models and points out the practicality of different models. The results of this process provide insights into the most important features for predicting creditworthiness and identify the most effective model for improving lending decisions on P2P platforms.

  - Abstract/Notes: Peer-to-peer lending as an innovation of financial services is a genuine opportunity for SMEs who are experiencing difficulties in accessing loans to formal financial institutions. The asymmetric information issue on peer-to-peer lending activity can lead to a credit risk that may cause a default loan. This research is a kind of associative research with the form of causal relationship. the purpose of this study is to determine the factors that influence the success of SMEs loans on Peer to peer lending activities. Samples obtained from the LendingClub platform using purposive sampling method. Analysis In this study using logistic regression analysis. Based on logistic regression analysis, it is found that loan amount, loan term, debt-to- income ratio, delinquency in last 2 year, inquiries in the last 6 month, and revolving credit utilization have a significant negative effect on the success of the loan. while annual income is not significant effect on the success of the loan.

  - Abstract/Notes: AbstractThere have been concerns about the use of alternative data sources by fintech lenders. We compare loans made by LendingClub and similar loans that were originated by banks. The correlations between the rating grades (assigned by LendingClub) and the borrowers’ FICO scores declined from about 80% (for loans originated in 2007) to about 35% for recent vintages (originated in 2014–2015), indicating that nontraditional data (not already accounted for in the FICO scores) have been increasingly used by fintech lenders. The rating grades perform well in predicting loan default. The use of alternative data has allowed some borrowers who would have been classified as subprime by traditional criteria to be slotted into “better” loan grades, allowing them to obtain lower priced credit.

  - Abstract/Notes: The study aims to determine a credit default prediction model using data from LendingClub. The model estimates the effect of the influential variables on the prediction process of paid and unpaid loans. We implemented the random forest algorithm to identify the variables with the most significant influence on payment or default, addressing nine predictors related to the borrower's credit and payment background. Results confirm that the model’s performance generates a F1 Macro Score that accomplishes 90% in accuracy for the evaluation sample. Contributions of this study include using the complete dataset of the entire operation of LendingClub available, to obtain transcendental variables for the classification and prediction task, which can be helpful to estimate the default in the person-to-person loan market. We can draw two important conclusions, first we confirm the Random Forest algorithm's capacity to predict binary classification problems based on performance metrics obtained and second, we denote the influence of traditional credit scoring variables on default prediction problems.

  - Abstract/Notes: SUMMARY We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The ‘lasso’ minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.
